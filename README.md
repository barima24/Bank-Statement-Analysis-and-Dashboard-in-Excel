# Bank-Statement-Analysis-and-Dashboard-in-Excel
In this project, I analysed bank transaction data to categorize expenses and visualize insights using Excel. Starting with raw data, I used VLOOKUP to categorize transactions based on predefined categories (e.g., entertainment, food, healthcare) from a separate categories sheet. Additionally, I applied math functions to clean and standardize amounts, extracting values for accurate analysis.

Using pivot tables, I summarized key metrics like total expenses, average monthly expenses, and transaction volume by category. I then designed a dashboard with charts for monthly expenses, transaction frequency, and a credit vs. debit comparison, along with a slicer for filtering by year. This dashboard enables quick, interactive exploration of spending patterns over time.

Here’s a brief description of each KPI on the dashboard:

- **Total Expense**: Represents the cumulative spending across all transactions over the selected time period. This metric provides an overall view of total expenditure.

-	**Average Expense Per Month**: Shows the monthly average spending, calculated by dividing the total expense by the number of months in the selected period. This helps track monthly spending trends.

-	**Transaction Volume**: Counts the total number of transactions in the dataset, giving insight into transaction frequency.

-	**Time Period**: Indicates the range of years included in the analysis, allowing users to understand the scope of the data.

-	**Application Used for Transactions**: Displays the platform or application through which the transactions were made, giving context to the spending medium.

Here’s a description of each pivot chart on my dashboard:

-	**Transaction Per Month**: This clustered column chart breaks down monthly transaction counts across different categories (e.g., Entertainment, Food, Mobile Services). It helps in understanding spending patterns and frequency per category each month, highlighting peak months for certain types of expenses.

-	**Monthly Expenses**: A line chart showing total spending across all categories for each month. This chart provides a visual trend of monthly expenses, allowing for easy identification of months with high or low spending, which can help in budgeting.

-	**Expenses by Category**: A pie chart that displays the percentage breakdown of total spending by category. This visual representation allows for quick insights into which categories consume the largest portion of the budget, helping identify areas where spending might be excessive.

-	**Credit vs Debit**: A 3D bar chart comparing the total values of credit and debit transactions. This chart provides a clear comparison of incoming versus outgoing funds, highlighting the net effect on the account balance.

Each chart is connected to slicers that allow for filtering by year, making it easy to analyse spending trends across different time periods. These visualizations provide a comprehensive view of the data, allowing for in-depth analysis and better financial decision-making.
